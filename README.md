# 🌪️ swapStorm
swapStorm is an optimized sorting project where we sort a list using a limited set of commands! 🚀 The goal is to choose the most efficient sorting algorithm while minimizing the number of operations, with a real algorithmic effort 💡.

This project is the implementation of Push-Swap with the use of the Turk Sort algorithm 🔄.

## 📋 Description
swapStorm implements the Push-Swap problem, where data is sorted on a stack using a minimal set of operations. The main objective is to sort the list efficiently by minimizing the number of operations through the Turk Sort algorithm.

## Key Features:
- Sorting with limited commands 🧑‍💻

- Optimized algorithmic effort to minimize operations ⚡

- Push-Swap solution with the Turk Sort algorithm 🔀

-  🌀 Stack A: The initial stack containing the unsorted integers.
-  🌀 Stack B: An auxiliary stack used during the sorting process.

## 💡 Algorithm
This project focuses on sorting a list with Turk Sort, an algorithm designed to minimize the number of actions required to sort using the stack-based push-swap method.

## Commands allowed 🧑‍💻
* SA → swap the first two elements of stack A.
* SB → swap the first two elements of the stack B.
* RA → the first element of the stack A becomes the last one.
* RB → the first element of stack B becomes the last one.
* RR → rotate stack A and B (ra and rb).
* RRA → the last element of stack A becomes the first one.
* RRB → the last element of stack B becomes the first one.
* RRR → reverse rotate A and B (rra and rrb).
* PA → push in stack A.
* PB → push in stack B.
